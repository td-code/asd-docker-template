## Development

The provided devcontainer comes with a few tools to help with development.

![Launch Simulation](doc/launch-tutorial.gif)

The above animation shows how to compile the project and start a simulation from inside vscode.

1. First open the noVNC page in a browser. Run `>Ports: Focus on Ports View` from the command palette and hit the preview button on Local Address `localhost:6080`. This will open a browser window inside vscode, connecting to noVNC inside the devcontainer (password: `vscode`).
2. Open the terminal panel and run the following commands:

    ```sh
    catkin_make -C /workspace # build the project
    source /workspace/devel/setup.bash # load project into ROS environment
    roslaunch car_demo demo_keyboard.launch # launch simulation
    ```

3. After starting the simulation switch back to noVNC. There you'll see the RViz GUI. If the window is out of view, right-click the taskbar and hit `Maximize`.

## Note for Mac users with Apple Silicon

If you encounter problems with novnc, please run the following commands:

```bash
vncserver -kill :1 2>/dev/null || true
pkill -f websockify || true

vncserver -geometry 1440x900 :1
websockify 6080 localhost:5901 --web /usr/share/novnc &
```

When asked for a password, enter vscode and skip the view-only password.
